  <h1>¡Hola!</h1>

  <p align="justify">
    My name is Ramón, welcome to my website! I am a computational scientist who specializes in the
    development of electronic structure and nuclear quantum dynamics algorithms. I hold a
    <a href="https://theses.fr/2020LILUR022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ph.D.</a>
    in Physics, with a focus on Theoretical Chemistry. I have experience in several programming languages,
    including C, Python, and Fortran, and am well-versed in high-performance and parallel computing libraries.
    In addition to my scientific pursuits I occasionally indulge in the craft of <a href="/content/poetry">verses</a>.
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    I've rediscovered the Lisp arts and the power of functional programming, ergo my affinity for
    <a href="https://panadestein.github.io/emacsd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emacs</a> and
    <a href="https://github.com/Panadestein/nixos-config" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NixOS</a>.
    As a firm believer in the beauty of simplicity, I consider the following expression to be a magnum opus:

    <code class="prettyprint">
      (define Y (λ (f) ((λ (x) (f (x x))) (λ (x) (f (x x))))))
    </code>
  </center>
