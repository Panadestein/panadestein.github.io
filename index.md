# ¡Hola!

My name is Ramón. I happen to hold a PhD in Physics, although my main research interests are in the field of  Theoretical and Computational Chemistry. Currently, I work in the development of open-source high-performance quantum chemistry software,  which will be tailored to the emerging exascale architectures. The methods of choice for this task are from the quantum Monte Carlo family, due to their suitability for massive parallelism.  Formerly, I worked in the development and application of optimization and tensor decomposition algorithms for obtaining Potential Energy Surfaces. I  am a Pythonista and Arch Linux lover, proficient user of the Scipy ecosystem libraries (Numpy, Marplotlib, Pandas).
