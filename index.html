  <h1>¡Hola!</h1>

  <p align="justify">
    Greetings and well met! I am  Ramón, a <a href="https://theses.fr/2020LILUR022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ph.D.</a> in Physics
    who specializes on Theoretical Chemistry. As a Computational Scientist, and I'm proficient in programming languages like C, Python, and Fortran,
    as well as several high-performance and parallel computing libraries. You can find more details on
    my <a href="/content/research">research</a> activities section, and on my
    <a href="https://github.com/Panadestein" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a> profile.
    In addition to my scientific pursuits I occasionally indulge in the craft of <a href="/content/poetry">verses</a>.

    Like the famous comic ponders, I've rediscovered the Lisp arts and come to deeply appreciate the
    expressiveness of it and of functional programming in general. This has led to my deep appreciation for
    <a href="https://panadestein.github.io/emacsd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emacs</a> and
    <a href="https://github.com/Panadestein/nixos-config" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NixOS</a>.
    As a firm believer in the beauty of simplicity, I consider the following expression to be a work of art:

    <code class="prettyprint">
      (define Y (λ (f) ((λ (x) (f (x x))) (λ (x) (f (x x))))))
    </code>
