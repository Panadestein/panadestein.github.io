  <h1>¡Hola!</h1>
  
  <p align="justify">
    My name is Ramón, welcome to my website! I hold a <a href="https://theses.fr/2020LILUR022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PhD</a> in physics, although the focus of my work has been so far in the field of theoretical and computational chemistry. I have experience in both the development and application of electronic structure and nuclear quantum dynamics methods. On this site, you can find more information about my <a href="/content/research">research</a> activities.

    I am very passionate about mathematics and computer science in general. The Emacs text editor is my favorite piece of software, see my <a href="https://panadestein.github.io/emacsd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">literate config</a>. I also happen to write <a href="/content/poetry">verses</a> sometimes. As a firm believer in the beauty of simplicity, I consider the following expression to be art:

    </code>
