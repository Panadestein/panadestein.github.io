    <h2>Drizzle without November</h2>

    <p>Summer ends on my no-dreams land.<br>
    The trees surround the isolation:<br>
    the old clochard that once lend me a verse<br>
    now is dust and butterflies,<br>
    and all my afternoons never existed.</p>
    
    <p>Now and always, that slight face.<br>
    The clarity of your eyes drawn in November,<br>
    stabbing the cold with<br>
    storms of broken innocence.</p>
    
    <p>An ancestral game:<br>
    mirrors and music dying<br>
    to feel your hands like knives,<br>
    to discover the stories buried in your hair,<br>
    to charm you with my dead and my living things.</p>
    
    <p>Then,<br>
    the drizzle,<br>
    the holes,<br>
    the absences,<br>
    these verses that are already yours,<br>
    everything can be used against me ...</p>
