  <h1>¡Hola!</h1>
  
  <p align="justify">
    My name is Ramón, welcome to my website! I hold PhD in Physics, although the focus of my work has been so far in the field of Theoretical and Computational Chemistry. I have experience in both the development and application of Electronic Structure and Nuclear Quantum Dynamics methods. <a href="/content/research">Here</a> you can find more information about my research activities.

  <p align="justify">
    I am very passionate about Numerical Mathematics and Computer Science in general. I also happen to write <a href="/content/poetry">write verses</a> sometimes, and listen a lot of Pink Floyd. I firmly believe in the beauty of simplicity, here is how I like to highlight it:
