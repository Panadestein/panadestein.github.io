  <h1>¡Hola!</h1>
  
  <p align="justify">
    My name is Ramón, welcome to my website! I hold a <a href="https://theses.fr/2020LILUR022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PhD</a> in physics, although the focus of my work has been so far in the field of theoretical and computational chemistry. I have experience in both the development and application of electronic structure and nuclear quantum dynamics methods. <a href="/content/research">Here</a> you can find more information about my research activities.

    I am very passionate about mathematics and computer science in general. I am an advocate of the Emacs text editor, see my <a href="https://panadestein.github.io/emacsd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">literate config</a>. I also happen to write <a href="/content/poetry">verses</a> sometimes. I firmly believe in the beauty of simplicity, here is how I like to highlight it:

    <code class="prettyprint">
    (import contextlib io)<br>
    (with [(contextlib.redirect_stdout<br>
             (setx zen (io.StringIO "")))]<br>
      (import this))<br>
    (print (get (.getvalue zen)<br>
                (slice 99 130)))<br>
    </code>
